The x-axis is the sum of the total system size or equipment that installers were committed to installing during that month, according to subsidy applications. For example, If an installers in an IOU installed 40 Kw of system in July 2010, and were named on subsidy applications for projects totaling another 60 Kw in system size in that IOU during July 2010, then the observation for that IOU-month-year has 40 Kw installed, and 100 Kw committed to. Note this means that installed projects are counted as commitments. Axes are scaled symmetrically and identically so as to fit all data and allow comparison. The blue points are IOU-month-year observations. The red line is the best linear fit.\relax }}{10}{}\protected@file@percent }
